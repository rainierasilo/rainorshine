Hola!
I am Mark Rainier T. Asilo. My old friends call me Mark but they call me right now at this moment, Rainier.
It's like I evolved from being a catterpillar to butterfly. 
I love being called Rainier because it's unique and not all has that name. 
I feel sorry for my old friends because they asked me why I did not let them call me Rainier before. 
I am a jolly person, I always laugh so loud it is always heard from afar, even from Cebuana people can hear it. 
Those are some of my raw descriptions. 
If you want to know me better, you should approach me. I am friendly, very very very.
